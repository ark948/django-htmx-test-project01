CSRF tokens are needed for post, put and delete http methods
most likley because these requests modify data or state of the application


(demonstrated in home app)

note: CSRF Token missing error will be displayed in server terminal, not in browser console



in order to send a post or put or delete request from client to server, CSRF token must be aquired and submitted along with the request.
django docs have a specific function for this that can be added to js (right above the event listener for publish buttons).

NOTE: this function can only be used if some settings are set,
e.g CSRF_USE_SESSIONS must be false
and CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY must be also false
