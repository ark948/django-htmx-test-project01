CSRF tokens are needed for post, put and delete http methods
most likley because these requests modify data or state of the application


(demonstrated in home app)

note: CSRF Token missing error will be displayed in server terminal, not in browser console



in order to send a post or put or delete request from client to server, CSRF token must be aquired and submitted along with the request.
django docs have a specific function for this that can be added to js (right above the event listener for publish buttons).

NOTE: this function can only be used if some settings are set,
e.g CSRF_USE_SESSIONS must be false
and CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY must be also false


after successfully sending the request with CSRF token, next if the process was ok, we should update the DOM.
we do that with HTMX.

actually bringing in HTMX can entirely replace all these plain js code. (but i'll keep them both for learning purposes)

to include CSRF tokens in HTMX request, we use django-htmx package, (tips > replace the body tag)
